# Phase 2 Improvements - Reducing Overfitting

## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified LSTM Architecture

**Before (Phase 1):**
- 5 LSTM layers with 80 units each
- ~200,000 trainable parameters
- Dropout: 0.2
- Fixed 50-60 epochs

**After (Phase 2):**
- 2 LSTM layers with 50 units each
- ~50,000 trainable parameters (75% reduction!)
- Dropout: 0.3 (increased)
- Up to 100 epochs with early stopping

**Code Changes:**
```python
# OLD: 5 layers x 80 units
def create_lstm_model(nodes=80, lookback, forecast):
    model.add(LSTM(units=nodes, return_sequences=True))
    model.add(Dropout(0.2))
    # ... 5 total LSTM layers

# NEW: 2 layers x 50 units
def create_lstm_model(nodes=50, lookback, forecast):
    model.add(LSTM(units=nodes, return_sequences=True))
    model.add(Dropout(0.3))  # Increased dropout
    model.add(LSTM(units=nodes))
    model.add(Dropout(0.3))
    model.add(Dense(forecast))
```

**Affected Models:**
- Main LSTM (Alchemist & Caterpillar)
- Optuna-optimized models
- Hybrid model residual forecasters

### 2. Early Stopping

**Addition:**
```python
from keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping

early_stop = EarlyStopping(
    monitor='val_loss',
    patience=10,  # Stop if no improvement for 10 epochs
    restore_best_weights=True,  # Use best weights, not final
    verbose=1
)

model.fit(..., callbacks=[early_stop])
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents overfitting by stopping training when validation loss stops improving
- Automatically finds optimal number of epochs
- Restores best weights instead of overfitted final weights

---

### 3. Time Series Cross-Validation

**New Function:**
```python
def time_series_cv_score(model_func, X, y, n_splits=3):
    """
    Expanding window cross-validation for time series.

    Fold 1: Train on [0:25%], validate on [25%:50%]
    Fold 2: Train on [0:50%], validate on [50%:75%]
    Fold 3: Train on [0:75%], validate on [75%:100%]
    """
    # Returns MAE scores for each fold
```

**Usage:**
```python
cv_scores = time_series_cv_score(create_cv_model, X_train, y_train, n_splits=3)
print(f"Mean CV MAE: {np.mean(cv_scores):.2f} (+/- {np.std(cv_scores):.2f})")
```

**Benefits:**
- More robust performance estimates
- Detect overfitting (high variance across folds)
- Better hyperparameter selection
- Expanding window respects time series structure

---

## Expected Performance Impact

### Parameter Reduction
- **Before**: ~200K parameters for ~600 training samples (ratio: 1:3)
- **After**: ~50K parameters for ~600 training samples (ratio: 1:12)
- **Impact**: 75% fewer parameters → less overfitting

### Generalization
- Early stopping prevents memorizing training noise
- Cross-validation shows model stability
- Higher dropout (0.3 vs 0.2) adds regularization

### Performance Expectations
Based on the changes:
- **Phase 1 MAPE**: ~33% (honest but overfitted)
- **Phase 2 MAPE**: Expected 28-31% (better generalization)
- **CV Std Dev**: Should be <20 MAE (stable model)

  - Lines 776-788: Added early stopping to Alchemist LSTM
  - Lines 835-849: Added early stopping to Caterpillar LSTM
  - Lines 872-879: Added CV evaluation
  - Lines 1124-1136: Updated hybrid model (increased dropout)
  - Lines 1148-1150: Added early stopping to hybrid models
  - Lines 1188-1190: Added early stopping to caterpillar hybrid

## How to Verify Improvements

Run the script and look for:

1. **Early Stopping Messages:**
   ```
   Epoch 00045: early stopping
   Restoring model weights from the end of the best epoch
   ```

2. **CV Results:**
   ```
   PHASE 2: Cross-validation for model stability assessment
     Running 3-fold time series CV...
     Fold 1: MAE = 185.32
     Fold 2: MAE = 192.45
     Fold 3: MAE = 188.91
   Mean CV MAE: 188.89 (+/- 2.93)
   ```
   - Low std dev (<20) = stable model
   - High std dev (>50) = overfitting

3. **Test Performance:**
   - Should see MAPE decrease from ~33% to 28-31%
   - More consistent predictions across different periods

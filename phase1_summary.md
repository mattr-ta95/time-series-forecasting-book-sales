# Phase 1 Fixes - Before & After Summary

## Critical Bugs Fixed

### Bug #1: Evaluating on Training Data (Data Leakage)

**BEFORE (Lines 789-806, Original Code):**
```python
# Predicting on TRAINING data
alchemist_train_predictions = lstm_model.predict(alchemist_train_input_lstm)
alchemist_predicted_lstm = pd.Series(alchemist_train_predictions[-32:].flatten(),
                                     index=alchemist_train_ml.index[-32:])

mae = mean_absolute_error(alchemist_train_ml[-32:], alchemist_predicted_lstm)
# Result: MAE 86.53, MAPE 12.8%
```
❌ **Problem**: Testing on data the model was trained on - meaningless metrics!

**AFTER (Fixed):**
```python
# Creating test sequences and predicting on TEST data
sequence_data_test = create_input_sequences_lstm(52, 32,
    np.concatenate([alchemist_train_lstm, alchemist_test_lstm]))
alchemist_test_input = np.array(sequence_data_test["input_sequences"])[-1:]
alchemist_test_predictions = lstm_model.predict(alchemist_test_input_scaled)

mae = mean_absolute_error(alchemist_test_ml, alchemist_predicted_lstm)
# Result: MAE 192.24, MAPE 32.8%
```
✓ **Fixed**: True out-of-sample forecasting performance!

**Impact**: Metrics look "worse" but are HONEST. The 32.8% MAPE reflects real forecasting ability, not overfitting.

### Bug #2: Optuna Models Never Trained

**BEFORE (Lines 925-943, Original Code):**
```python
# Build model with best params
alchemist_best_model = build_lstm_model_with_params(best_units_alc, best_dropout_alc)

# Create windows
alchemist_input_sequences = [...]

# PREDICT WITHOUT TRAINING!
alchemist_forecast = alchemist_best_model.predict(alchemist_input_sequences)
```
❌ **Problem**: Model predicting with random untrained weights!

**AFTER (Fixed):**
```python
# Build model
alchemist_best_model = build_lstm_model_with_params(best_units_alc, best_dropout_alc, forecast_steps=32)

# Prepare data
X_train_alc, y_train_alc = create_sequences(...)

# ACTUALLY TRAIN THE MODEL
alchemist_best_model.fit(X_train_alc, y_train_alc, epochs=30, batch_size=32)

# Then predict on test data
alchemist_forecast_optuna = alchemist_best_model.predict(X_test_alc)
```
✓ **Fixed**: Model actually learns patterns before forecasting!

**Impact**: Predictions went from random noise to actual learned forecasts.

---

### Bug #3: Inconsistent Scaling

**BEFORE (Lines 770-772, Original Code):**
```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
alchemist_train_input_lstm = scaler.fit_transform(...)  # Fit scaler
scaled_output = scaler.fit_transform(...)              # FIT AGAIN! Wrong!
```
❌ **Problem**: Different scaling for inputs and outputs breaks relationships!

**AFTER (Fixed):**
```python
scaler_alchemist = StandardScaler()
alchemist_train_input_lstm_scaled = scaler_alchemist.fit_transform(...)
scaled_output = scaler_alchemist.transform(...)  # Use transform, not fit_transform!
```
✓ **Fixed**: Consistent scaling preserves input-output relationships!

**Impact**: Model learns correct relationships between past and future values.

---

### Bug #4: Hybrid Model Broadcasting Single Residual

**BEFORE (Lines 1118-1142, Original Code):**
```python
# Model outputs only 1 value
model.add(Dense(1))

# Get single prediction
lstm_predictions = best_model.predict(alchemist_residuals_train_input)
lstm_predictions = lstm_predictions[-1]  # Single value!

# Add to all 32 forecasts
final_predictions = sarima_predictions + lstm_predictions  # Broadcasting!
```
❌ **Problem**: Same residual adjustment for all 32 weeks - clearly wrong!

**AFTER (Fixed):**
```python
# Model outputs 32 values
def create_hybrid_lstm_model(forecast_steps=32):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(LSTM(...))
    model.add(Dense(forecast_steps))  # Outputs 32 residuals!
    return model

# Forecast 32 residuals
last_residuals = residuals.values[-52:].reshape(1, 52, 1)
lstm_residual_forecast = hybrid_model.predict(last_residuals).flatten()  # 32 values

# Combine properly
final_predictions = sarima_predictions + lstm_residual_forecast  # Both 32 values!
```
✓ **Fixed**: Different residual adjustment for each forecast period!

**Impact**: Hybrid model can now capture time-varying residual patterns.

## Summary Results

| Metric | Before (Wrong) | After (Fixed) | Explanation |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| LSTM MAE | 86.53 | 192.24 | Before measured training fit, after measures true forecast |
| LSTM MAPE | 12.8% | 32.8% | Honest metric shows real forecasting difficulty |
| Optuna | Random | Trained | Models now actually learn from data |
| Scaling | Inconsistent | Consistent | Preserves data relationships |
| Hybrid | 1 residual | 32 residuals | Captures time-varying patterns |

## Why Results Look "Worse"

**You weren't getting bad results - you were getting FAKE results!**

The original code was showing how well models fit training data (overfitting), not how well they forecast.

The "worse" numbers after fixes are actually **BETTER** because they're:
- Honest about forecasting performance
- Based on unseen test data
- Measuring real-world predictive ability

A 32-35% MAPE on volatile book sales is **reasonable** - books have:
- Seasonal patterns
- Marketing campaigns
- Random bestseller effects
- Competition dynamics

These are genuinely hard to predict!

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. Simplify overly complex LSTM architectures (reduce overfitting)
2. Add proper cross-validation
3. Implement early stopping
4. Better feature engineering
5. Add baseline models for comparison
